## Abstract
Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive
results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational
demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work
introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR addresses the
distortion-perception trade-off within the latent space and produces high-quality images
using a latent consistency flow-based model. In addition, ELIR introduces an efficient
and lightweight architecture. Consequently, ELIR is 4x smaller and faster than stateof-
the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches for blind face restoration, enabling a deployment
on resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image
restoration tasks and datasets show that ELIR achieves competitive performance compared
to state-of-the-art methods, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality
metrics while significantly reducing model size and computational cost.
